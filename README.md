What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is extensively used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating the process of integrating changes from different contributors more efficiently and frequently.
