# What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is extensively used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating the process of integrating changes from different contributors more efficiently and frequently.
# Key Features of Jenkins
1. Extensibility: Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins that extend its capabilities. The Jenkins plugin ecosystem is rich, covering areas like source code management, build tools, automated testing, and deployment.

2. Easy Configuration: Jenkins provides an easy-to-use web interface that helps in the configuration of jobs and pipelines. Configuration can be done through UI forms or by using Jenkins' configuration-as-code feature for more complex setups.

3. Distributed Builds: Jenkins can distribute build and test loads across multiple machines, making it suitable for large-scale projects. This capability helps in speeding up the build process.

4. Pipeline as Code: Jenkins supports defining build pipelines using code, often through Jenkinsfile, which is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control.

5. Integration with Other Tools: Jenkins integrates with various tools and services, including version control systems (like Git), build tools (like Maven and Gradle), and testing frameworks (like JUnit).
